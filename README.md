# CO2-and-Temperature
Just practicing data
Global Climate Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks focused on analyzing and visualizing data related to global climate trends. The notebooks analyze historical data on global temperatures and CO2 emissions, with an emphasis on uncovering trends, visualizing insights, and exploring correlations.
 

Notebooks
1. World Bank CO2 Analysis
Filename: World_Bank_CO2.ipynb
Description:
 This notebook analyzes CO2 emission data from the World Bank. The dataset is cleaned and processed to explore trends, visualize country-specific contributions, and compare emissions over the years. The focus is on understanding emission patterns by region and exploring and future projects on the implications for sustainability efforts.
Key Features:
Data cleaning and preparation.
Data preprocessing and handling of missing values.
Visualization of CO2 emissions by region and globally.
Identification of top CO2-emitting countries.
Exploration of trends over time using compelling visualizations.
Objectives:
Provide insights into the primary contributors to CO2 emissions.
Explore relationships between economic growth and emissions.
 

2. Global Temperature Trends (40 Years).
Filename: Global_temperatura_40years.ipynb
Description:
 This notebook delves into historical global temperature data over the past 40 years. Using historical temperature data, it highlights the increasing trends and regional variations in global warming.
Key Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Trend analysis with clear visualizations.
Visualization of global temperature changes by year.
Highlights of significant temperature changes over time.
Objectives:
Identify key patterns in global temperature changes.
Communicate findings through visual storytelling

3. Compare CO2 Emissions and Global Temperature.
Filename: C02_and_Global_Temperature.ipynb
Description:
 This notebook integrates the analyses from the previous two notebooks to establish relationships between CO2 emissions and global temperature increases. It provides correlations between human activity and climate change.
Key Features:
Correlation analysis between CO2 emissions and global temperatures.
Visualization of combined datasets.
Visualizations comparing trends across time.
Objectives:
Investigate the interplay between emissions and temperature changes.
Present findings in an accessible and engaging manner.
